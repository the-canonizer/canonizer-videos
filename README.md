Canonizer videos on consciousness and stuff.

This repository contains videos and source files of all the animation work demonstrating how consciousness works. Because of the large file sizes inherent to video, we cannot host intermediate video files here, neither can we the final output videos - you can see the latter at https://canonizer.com/videos/consciousness
