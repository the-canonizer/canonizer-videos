Canonizer videos on consciousness and stuff.

In order to run this locally, without a local server, you need to enable loading of the .vtt file.

This requires the usage of the --allow-file-access-from-files switch when you start the browser.

But if the browser is already running, the switch doesn't work, so you need to kill the browser with one of the kill bat files first.

You also need to install the awsome fonts at this location:
C:\font-awesome
